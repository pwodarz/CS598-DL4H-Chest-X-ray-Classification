Project Difficulties
Team 1791


One of the biggest difficulties of the project was getting good results with our Simple and Extended CNN models.  The training was poor as the loss leveled off quickly, usually around 10 epochs or less.  Attempts for improvement were made, first with learning rate and output feature maps and then with more common techniques such as batch normalization and leaky relus.  However,  we did not see much improvement.  Secondly it was difficult to determine how to architect our CNN models.  We wanted to add more layers to improve feature recognition but were worried about the poor learning we were getting.  In the end we just kept things to a minimum.  Another issue was the time required to run the ResNet and DensNet models.  These models took many hours to run and so we chose to use Googl Colab which allowed us to run on their GPUs.  In the end we did get good results.
